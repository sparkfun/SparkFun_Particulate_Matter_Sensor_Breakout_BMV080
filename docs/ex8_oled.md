This example shows how to read the BMV080 via Qwiic when the sensor is configured in duty cycle mode and outputs sensor data to a connected Qwiic OLED Display (specifically the 1.3", 128x64). You'll need a [Qwiic OLED Display](https://www.sparkfun.com/sparkfun-qwiic-oled-1-3in-128x64.html) connected to the Qwiic circuit to run this example.

Head to the example 8 from the Arduino IDE's menu (located in **File** **Examples** > **SparkFun BMV080 Arduino Library** > **Example_08_Demo_OLED**).

If you have not already, select your Board and associated COM port. Upload the code to the board and set the [Arduino Serial Monitor](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/terminal-basics/all#arduino-serial-monitor-windows-mac-linux) to **115200** baud. The Arduino should begin outputting the sensor readings through the Arduino Serial Monitor and the Qwiic OLED Display (1.3", 128x64).
