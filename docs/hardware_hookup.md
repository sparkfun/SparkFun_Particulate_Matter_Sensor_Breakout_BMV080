### Connecting via PTH

For temporary connections to the PTHs, you could use IC hooks to test out the pins. However, you'll need to solder headers or wires of your choice to the board for a secure connection. You can choose between a combination of [header pins and jumper wires](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-solder-through-hole-soldering/all), or [stripping wire and soldering the wire](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/working-with-wire/all) directly to the board.
