The enclosure does expose the solder jumpers and PTH pins for users to access while the board is inside the enclosure. While it is possible to access these parts of the board, we recommend removing the breakout from the enclosure prior to working with either the solder jumpers or PTH pins. </p> <p>We strongly recommend putting on Latex or Nitrile gloves (and not following our bad example in the photos below) before removing the board from the enclosure. Also, make sure to perform these steps on a clean and flat surface. Whether or not you decide to use gloves, do your best to avoid touching the enclosure's glass sensor cover and do not touch the bare sensor or any of the passive components (resistors/capacitors) near it:</p> <p> </p> <p>Start by identifying the two slots on either side of the enclosure. Next, carefully slide a precision flathead screwdriver or similar precise tool into one of the slots and gently wedge it under the tab. Rock the precision flathead's handle toward the mounting hole so the tab pops out.</p> <p> </p> <p>Repeat this step on the other side to \"unlock\" the two pieces of the enclosure, then carefully remove the outer shell of the enclosure.</p> <p> </p> <p>Next, identify the rubber O-ring and lens cover (beneath the O-ring) covering the BMV080 aperture. Using tweezers, first remove the O-ring and then the lens cover. Make sure to place them on a clean surface to avoid contaminating them with dust or other substances:</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>With the O-ring and lens cover removed, the assembly should look like the photo below:</p> <p> </p> <p>The inner shell of the enclosure has a small notch to lock the breakout board into place inside. Using either your fingertip or tweezers, gently press down on the edge of the breakout board while pressing from the other side to slide the board out from the inner shell.</p> <p> </p> <p>Slide the sensor out from the inner shell's slot while taking care to avoid touching the BMV080 sensor and passive components on the sensor's ribbon cable. </p> <p> </p> <p>Now that the breakout board is out of the enclosure we can solder to the board and adjust the solder jumpers. If using male header pins, solder the short end from the top side of the board so that you can access the longer mating pins from the bottom side. If you're soldering wires, make sure to trim the leads as short as possible to avoid obstructing the board from sliding back into the enclosure. After soldering, carefully clean the solder joints to remove any flux residue left on the board using isopropyl alcohol and a Q-tip or other gentle cleaning tool.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>When soldering make sure to not add too much solder. Excess solder can obstruct the breakout board from sliding back into the inner shell. For users soldering header pins, ensure that the header's plastic spacer is flush against the breakout board and not at an angle. For users soldering wire, ensure that the stripped wire is short.</p>"},{"location":"hardware_assembly/#reassembling-the-enclosure","title":"Reassembling the Enclosure","text":"<p>Once we're done modifying the breakout board we'll want to place the sensor back in the enclosure.

While it is possible to access these parts of the board, we recommend removing the breakout from the enclosure prior to working with either the solder jumpers or PTH pins. </p> <p>We strongly recommend putting on Latex or Nitrile gloves (and not following our bad example in the photos below) before removing the board from the enclosure. Also, make sure to perform these steps on a clean and flat surface. Whether or not you decide to use gloves, do your best to avoid touching the enclosure's glass sensor cover and do not touch the bare sensor or any of the passive components (resistors/capacitors) near it:</p> <p> </p> <p>Start by identifying the two slots on either side of the enclosure. Next, carefully slide a precision flathead screwdriver or similar precise tool into one of the slots and gently wedge it under the tab. Rock the precision flathead's handle toward the mounting hole so the tab pops out.</p> <p> </p> <p>Repeat this step on the other side to \"unlock\" the two pieces of the enclosure, then carefully remove the outer shell of the enclosure.</p> <p> </p> <p>Next, identify the rubber O-ring and lens cover (beneath the O-ring) covering the BMV080 aperture.

If using male header pins, solder the short end from the top side of the board so that you can access the longer mating pins from the bottom side. If you're soldering wires, make sure to trim the leads as short as possible to avoid obstructing the board from sliding back into the enclosure. After soldering, carefully clean the solder joints to remove any flux residue left on the board using isopropyl alcohol and a Q-tip or other gentle cleaning tool.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>When soldering make sure to not add too much solder.
